    "Q3) The choice of base learner affects the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. Low-bias base learners benefit from bagging by reducing           variance, while high-bias base learners benefit from bagging by reducing bias. The overall effect of bagging is to improve the ensemble     model's performance by combining the predictions of multiple base learners and achieving a more optimal bias-variance tradeoff."
